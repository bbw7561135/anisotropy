## Follow these steps if you want or need to make your own likelihood tables ##

resourcedir = directory where you want your ShowerLLH resource files stored

1. Run MakeBins.py
  - usage MakeBins.py [resourcedir]
  - creates the bins for EZSDC (energy, zenith, snow depth, distance, & charge)
  - modify bins if desired

2. Run MakeGrid.py
  - usage MakeGrid.py [resourcedir]
  - creates the coarse, middle, and fine distance spots for grid search

3. Run maker.py
  - mass submits MakeHist.py to the cluster
  - MakeHist.py
    - creates count tables using AddToHist
    - stored as .npy files

4. Run merger.py
  - merges .npy files produced by MakeHist.py

5. Run TableConverter.py
  - converts count tables created by MakeHist into a single,
    normalized file of LLHs
